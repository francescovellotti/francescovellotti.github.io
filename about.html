                    <p>Here is where I got my Bachelor's Degree in Foreign Languages and Cultures. The courses were mostly focused on the study of the languages and the literatures of the corresponding cultures.Through these courses, I was able to improve my knowledge of the cultures I was studying and my mastery of the languages. It is also where I started to deeply focus on the matters of linguistics and translation.</p>

                    <p>What I've started on the path to my first degree continued here. At the same University, I got my Master's degree in Languages, Comparative Literatures and Intercultural Translation by focusing way more on the comparisons between different cultures, which is a fundamental part of translation itself. As Umberto Eco would have said, translation is "saying almost the same thing" and this is only possible by knowing the cultures we are referring to.</p>

This really helped me to better understand the features of marketing, commerce and e-commerce, via the lessons and conferences of important figures in these fields. I was even invited at the Parliament in Rome to receive a certificate to testify this accomplishment.</p>

This job really helped me to improve my English and especially to understand more hardware-related matters when it comes to Information Technology.

I was right.</p>

My job was to translate many things, from the descriptions of the monuments to the structure of the website itself, and I had to do it in a "catchy" way. This happened in 2016 and this was the first time I approached the field of online marketing.</p>
